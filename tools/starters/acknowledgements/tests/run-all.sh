# Run every kit self-test.
#
# This script is the single source of the kit's test list. CI invokes it
# rather than restating the list, so a test added here is a test CI runs —
# there is no second place to forget.
#
# It also makes the suite runnable by anyone who adopted the kit from the
# public mirror, where the upstream CI workflow does not travel. See
# `kit-tests.yml.snippet` beside the kit for a workflow you can copy into
# your own `.github/workflows/`, including the external tool versions the
# driver tests expect.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/run-all.sh                 # run everything; skips are tolerated
#   tests/run-all.sh --require-all   # a skipped test is a failure (CI)
#   tests/run-all.sh --list          # print the test list, run nothing
#
# Why --require-all: several driver tests exit 0 with a `skip:` line when
# their external tool or network is unavailable, so a provisioning
# regression would otherwise show up as a green run with three ecosystems
# silently unexercised. CI passes --require-all so "green" means "every
# test actually ran".
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every test passed (and, under --require-all, none skipped)
#   1  a test failed, or skipped while --require-all was set
#   2  CLI argument error
