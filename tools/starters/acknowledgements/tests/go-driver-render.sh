# Go-driver round-trip test.
#
# Stands up a self-contained Go module fixture whose only third-party
# dependency is a local module pulled in via a `replace` directive (no
# network), then drives the full generate-acknowledgements.sh dispatcher
# with a `[[blocks]]` entry of `ecosystem = "go"`. Asserts:
#
#   1. Dispatcher exits 0 and splices a non-empty block between the
#      per-block markers.
#   2. The rendered block lists the third-party module + its licence,
#      and EXCLUDES the fixture's own main module.
#   3. Output is sorted (deterministic) and idempotent (--check exits 0).
#   4. Hand-curated content outside the markers survives regeneration.
#
# Skips cleanly (exit 0 with a stderr note) if `go` or `go-licenses` is
# not on PATH — CI installs both before invoking this test.
#
# Local invocation:
#   tools/starters/acknowledgements/tests/go-driver-render.sh
